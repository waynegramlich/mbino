Introduction

								<P>
The MBino is an Arduino<Sup>&reg;</Sup> compatible
processor board and can be plugged into a MakerBus.
The MBino has the following features:
								<UL><LI>
    The MBino has the same physical size and
    characteristics as an Arduino<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Uno.
    This includes exact board shape, mounting holes,
    connector placement, etc.  The only difference is
    that the MBino does not have a USB B connector.
								</LI><LI>
    Instead of a USB B connector, the MBino has a
    3-pin connector that is compatible with FTDI
	<A HRef="http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/Cables/USBTTLSerial.htm">
    TTL-232R-3V3</A> 3.3V FTDI USB to 6-pin serial
    cable from
	<A HRef="http://www.ftdichip.com/">
    FTDI</A>.
								</LI><LI>
    The MBino has an AVR ATmega324 proecessor instead
    of an AVR ATMega328.  The ATmega324 has 2 UART's,
    one of which is used by the Arduino IDE and
    the other which is dedicated to the MakerBus.
								</LI><LI>
    The MBino is has a bootloader that is compatible
    with the Arduino IDE.
								</LI><LI>
    All shield boards that that are designed to work
    with the Arduino Uno will work with the MBino.
								</LI><LI>
    The MBino can be physically reset from the MakeBus.
    (implemented in upcoming Rev. C), not Rev. B.
