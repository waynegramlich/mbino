There are two 2.1mm power jacks , N1 and N3.
N1 feeds power through protection diode D1 and
protection resettable polyfuse F2 to the LPWR1
and LWPR2 pins of MakeBus connector N2.  D1 protects
everthing if the power accidentally comes in with
reverse polarity on N1.  (Connector N2 is labeled as
"Robus" which is the previous bus name to "MakerBus".)
The ground line of N1 is also connected to LGND1
and LGND2 of N2.  The same thing happens with N3,
F1, and D2 with BPWR1, BPWR2, BGND1, and BGND2 on N2.
								</P><P>
The LPWR1 and LPWR1 lines from N2 are further connected
to the 5V linear regulator U1 and the 3.3V linear
regulator U2 to provide 5 volts and 3.3 volts respectively.
								</P><P>
CANH and CANL of N2 or connected to the 5V CAN bus
transceiver chip U3.  The 1 &times; 3 jumper J1 can
be jumpered to connect a 124 ohm termination resistor R6.
The 24K resistor R9 enables slope control for U3.
The TXD and RXD pins are connected to the microcontroller
U4 pins PD3 (TXD1) and PD2 (RXD1).  Capacitors C5-C10
are .1&micro;F bypass capacitors for U4 and U3.
16MHz crystal X1 and crystal 22pF capactiors C4 and C5
provide the 16MHz frequency reference for U4.
								</P><P>
Connector N4 is a 2&times;8 pin combined JTAG and
serial download connector that connects to the
various JTAG pins on the microcontroller (U4).
The serial debug lines from N4 are also connected
to the 1&times;6 serial cable pin N5 before
connecting to PD1 (TXD0) and PD0 (RXD0) on U4
through 1K ohm resistors R2 and R3.  R2 and R3
pins D0 (N9) and D1 (N9) to have priority over
over both N4 and N5 is voltage sources are connected
to both at the same time.  It is a really bad idea
to attempt to use both N4 and N5 for serial downloading
at the same time.  10K ohm resistor R1 and 1&micro;F
capacitor C12 provide a simple reset circuit to trigger
RESET on U4.  The reset button SW1 can also be used
to manually reset U4.
								</P><P>
470 Ohm resistor R8 and LED D4 are connected to D13
(N8) to provide an on-board LED.  470 ohm resistor R7
and bicolor LED D3 are only meant to be used for
debugging; they are not installed in the final product.
Connectors N6 (Power/Reset pins), N7 (ISP header),
N8 (D0-D13, GND, AREF), N9 (D0-D7) and N10 (A0-A5)
are used used to connect to Arduino compatible shields.
								</P><P>
4.7K ohm resistors R4 and R5 are available to be used
as pull up resistors for the I<Sup>2</Sup>C bus pins
connected to D13 (SCK) and D12 (MISO) pins on U4.

The following errors and issues are noted:

    A reset circuit for MakerBus is needed.
								</LI></UL>
								</P><P>
The design notes for the reset circuit are:
								<UL><LI>
Use a SNLVC2G06 (dual open collector inverter):
								</LI><LI>
At VCC = 5V:
								<UL><LI>
   V<Sub>IH</Sub> = .7 * V<Sub>CC</Sub> = 3.5V
								</LI><LI>
   V<Sub>IL</Sub> = .3 * V<Sub>CC</Sub> = 1.5V
								</LI><LI>
   V<Sub>OL</Sub> = .55V
								</LI><LI>
   I<Sub>OL</Sub> = 32mA
								</LI></UL>
								</LI><LI>
Assuming that the capacitor is clamped to VOL most
of the time, the R*C that corresponds to charging
from VOL to VIH in T seconds is the
the basic capacitor charging equation:
								</LI><UL><LI>
  V(t) = V<Sub>OL</Sub> + (V<Sub>CC</Sub> -
     V<Sub>OL</Sub>) * (1 - e<Sup>-t/R*C</Sup>)
								</LI></UL><LI>
Replacing V(t) with V<Sub>IH</Sub> and T:
								<UL><LI>
  V<Sub>IH</Sub> = V<Sub>OL</Sub> + (V<Sub>CC</Sub> -
    V<Sub>OL</Sub>) * (1 - e<Sup>-T/R*C</Sup>)
								</LI></UL>
								</LI><LI>
Solving for RC:
								<UL><LI>
  (V<Sub>IH</Sub> - V<Sub>OL</Sub>)/(V<Sub>CC</Sub> - V<Sub>L</Sub>) = 
  1 - e<Sup>-T/R*C</Sup>
								</LI><LI>
  e<Sup>-T/R*C</Sup> = 1 - (V<Sub>IH</Sub> -
    V<Sub>OL</Sub>)/(V<Sub>CC</Sub> - V<Sub>OL</Sub>)
								</LI><LI>
  -T/R*C = ln(1 - (V<Sub>IH</Sub> -
    V<Sub>OL</Sub>)/(V<Sub>CC</Sub> - V<Sub>OL</Sub>))
								</LI><LI>
  R*C = -T/ln(1 - (V<Sub>IH</Sub> -
    V<Sub>OL</Sub>)/(V<Sub>CC</Sub> - V<Sub>OL</Sub>))
								</LI></UL>
								</LI><LI>
Substituting in for T=1mS, V<Sub>IH</Sub>,
V<Sub>OL</Sub>, and V<Sub>CC</Sub>:
								<UL><LI>
  R*C =  -.001/ln(1 - (3.5 - .55)/(5 - .55))
								</LI><LI>
  R*C = -.001/-1.08744
								</LI><LI>
  R*C = .009196
								</LI></UL>
								</LI><LI>
Setting C = .1&micro;F
								<UL><LI>
  R = .009196 / .0000001 = 9196
								</LI></UL>
Using an R near 10K should do the trick.
								</LI><LI>
The maximum discharge current is I<Sub>OL</Sub>.  Use Ohm's law
to determine determine discharge resistor:
								<UL><LI>
   V = I * R
								</LI><LI>
   R = V / I
     = 5 / .032
     = 156.25
								</LI></UL>
Setting R<Sub>discharge</Sub> = 180 should be good enough.
								</LI><LI>
The charge/discharge ratio is:
								<UL><LI>
  R<Sub>charge</Sub>/R<Sub>discharge</Sub> = 10K/180 = 55.5

The short answer is:
								<Pre>
    cd .../hardware
    (cd arduino; tar cvf /tmp/arduino.tar .)
    (mkdir {your_board_dir}; tar xvf /tmp/arduino.tar)
    # now edit {your_board_dir}/boards.txt to configure your board
    # now edit {your_board_dir}/programmers.txt
								</Pre>
The problem with this strategy is that you get a snap-shot of
all the files and everything becomes out of date when the next
release of the Arduino IDE comes out.  A better way is probably
to have a shell script that make a copy of arduino files followed
by a file that unzips the stuff that needs to be changed.  That
may be just a few files.
								</P><P>
Here are the files that have been edited so far:
								<DL><DT>
  .../MBino/variants/standard/pins_arduino.h:			</DT><DD>
								<Pre>
    // Add 4 pins to the vector for I2C SDA, SCL, and external pull-ups
    SDA = 20
    SCL = 21

    port_to_mode_PGM = {
	// Add &DDRA,	// ATmega324 has a Port A

    port_to_output_PGM = {
	// Add &PORTA,	// ATmega324 has a Port A

    port_to_input_PGM = {
	// Add &PINA,	// ATmega324 has a Port A

    digital_pin_to_port_PGM = {
	// Remap digital pin ports

    digital_pin_to_bit_mask_PGM = {
	// Remap bit masks
								</Pre>
Obviously thes is pretty minor changes.
