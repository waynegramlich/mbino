Patches:

1) Swap TXD and RXD for Serial connector
2) Add .1uF capacitor between RCS (green) on serial connector and reset rail
3) Do not install power protection diodes, use wires instead.

Notes:

0) Move references off vias because vias are not tented
1) Make the small mounting hole bigger.
2) Add a 4th hole that aligns in lower left with Uno
3) Make the holes true mechanical holes
4) Make the test points have a hole in them.
5) Rotate the fuses to horizontal
6) Fix the diode footprints
7) Move the serial connector back so pins do not stick out
8) Think about using a SOT89 for 3V3 regulator.
9) Provide an on board LED
10) Change 4K7 I2C pull-up resistors to 2K2?
11) Look for smaller fuses?
12) Fix the swapped TX/RX lines on serial connector
13) Think about adding a 3V3 step-down voltage for serial cable.
14) Fix reset button
15) Make reset circuit identical to Uno -- add .1 uF capacitor,
    1K pull-down, and over voltage spike protection diode.
16) Switch from ATmega324A to ATmega324PA
17) Add jumpers comparable to Uno's
18) Put a plus sign next to LED
19) Connect ground (VSS) to Rs (pin 8) of U3 to put it into high speed mode
20) Artwork for Terminate is reversed
